This replaces the Zulu Desktop Client and people should migrate from that.

Except if you're a Linux user, in which case it sucks to be you... we've not bothered making a Linux version unlike what we did with Zulu.

HAHAHA

We love how it completely makes no sense how much of our technology depends on Linux, but we slap Linux desktop users in the face with things like this!
